# Swarm_robot_motion_planning
Master Thesis program written in MATLAB code. Additionaly Master Thesis paper was attached for readers.

## How to run?
There are two types of motion planning programes:
One of them is related to common algortihms Dijkstra and A*. 
Second one is related to my idea to create evolutionary algoorithm which can mimic behaviour of nature. In this case there was a school fish motion.

In both cases randomly generated world was created to test algorithm.
Additionaly, an animation was developed to show how robots moves in various types of worlds.

The Master Thesis paper summing up research and show aim and goals of work.
